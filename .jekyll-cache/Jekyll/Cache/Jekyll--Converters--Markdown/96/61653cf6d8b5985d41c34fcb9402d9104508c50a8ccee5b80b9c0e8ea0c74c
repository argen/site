<p>Interesting article on a controversial topic thatâ€™s hot on the startup world nowadays. This is something that I have also thought myself as well sometimes.</p>

<p>While I donâ€™t agree with Scottâ€™s point of view entirely the <em>â€œthe living dead equity problemâ€</em> is something very real and something that should be addressed. How? not sure at this stage but itâ€™s something that needs to be addressed.</p>
