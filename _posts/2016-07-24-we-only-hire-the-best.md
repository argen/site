### [“We only hire the best” — Signal v. Noise](https://m.signalvnoise.com/we-only-hire-the-best-c711c330fc2e#.mn0n5ya7n)

Great article by [DDH](https://twitter.com/dhh) worth reading if you are trying to recruit people thee are some obvious paths that you want to avoid pursuing.

I think the following is true and it's one of the better qualities to look out there when evaluating profiles:

> The best are generally the best because they aren’t typical. Because they came at things from a different angle that gave them a unique perspective, which happens to provide more insights than the widely-distributed approaches.

At the end you want people in a team to have a different skillset and different approach to problem solving. If your team is always filled up with the same type of people you will probably be losing on a huge amount of insight and value out there.
