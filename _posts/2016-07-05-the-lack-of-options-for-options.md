### [The Lack of Options for (Startup Employees’) Options – Andreessen Horowitz](https://a16z.com/2016/06/23/options-timing/)

Interesting article on a controversial topic that’s hot on the startup world nowadays. This is something that I have also thought myself as well sometimes.

While I don’t agree with Scott’s point of view entirely the *"the living dead equity problem"* is something very real and something that should be addressed. How? not sure at this stage but it’s something that needs to be addressed.
