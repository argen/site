It's no secret that this is the _work from home_ year for most of us. COVID-19 has substantially accelerated the rate in which people working _"9 to 5 office jobs"_ started working from their homes or remote locations without the need of being in the same room with their colleagues.

Having worked remotely for about 7 years, I have learned (sometimes the hard way) many things that helped me collaborate and get things done whilst not being in the same room with others. In this post I want to share some of these with you, hoping it will help you add some tools that you can use during your day to day.

### Own your time

> Make space and design your days for the things that really matter.

Ever got to 5pm on the day and realise you haven't started any of the work you wanted or needed to do? I've been there too.

What Gives/Drains Energy?

People often spend time on things that don't matter to them out of pure courtesy to others. Don't be afraid of saying no. That doesn't mean you need to become a despicable person. Just make sure to ask what's the purpose of the meeting/call to validate wether you want to commit your time to it or not. If it doesn't need your time, or you have another priority that's a conflict just say you won't attend. You can always review meeting notes or follow up on any actions needed after. If people really need you, they'll insist in you attending.


### Async-first

> Use real-time communication sometimes, but favour asynchronous communication most of the time.

What does that mean? The next time you open your calendar app and try to add something or think "we should have a meeting to..." **STOP**. Really think if you need to discuss this in a video call or real-time meeting. Can't this meeting be an email? Or maybe a Slack thread or Direct Message that your colleagues can follow up on their own time. 

Meetings are also expensive for your company. Four people in a meeting for an hour isn't a one hour meeting, it's a four hour meeting. If your average hourly cost of employment is ~£100, then that meeting is £400 investment in only one hour. If you didn't really have a purpose or achieved anything during the meeting it's just waste. That time and money could have been used for something else.

Meetings should be your last resort, not the first option.

### Explore the great outdoors

### Build (and iterate) a routine

### Get feedback

### More than business

#### Additional resources

Note:


During the retro I remember people mentioning that they were struggling a bit with meeting fatigue and finding time to focus (I am too!). Earlier this year I've read a book that really help me with time management, it's called Make Time https://maketime.blog/articles/ (written by the same guy that wrote the Design Sprint). Their site also has great tips and blog posts in case you don't fancy reading the book.
