It's no secret that this is the _"Work from home"_ or _"Remote working"_ year for most of us. COVID-19 has substantially accelerated the rate in which people around blue collar jobs started working without attending offices on a daily basis.

Having worked remotely for about 7 years I have learned the hard way many things that helped me collaborate and get things done whilst not being in the same room with others. Here's some of the things that helped me work and collaborate with others remotely over the last few years.

### Make Time

### Async-first

Use real-time communication sometimes, but favour asynchronous communication most of the time.

What does that mean? The next time you open your calendar app and try to add something or think "we should have a meeting to..." STOP. Really think if you need to discuss this in a video call or real-time meeting. Can't this meeting be an email? Or maybe a Slack thread or Direct Message that your colleagues can follow up on their own time. 

Meetings should be your last resort, not the first option.

### Get feedback

### More than business

#### Additional resources




During the retro I remember people mentioning that they were struggling a bit with meeting fatigue and finding time to focus (I am too!). Earlier this year I've read a book that really help me with time management, it's called Make Time https://maketime.blog/articles/ (written by the same guy that wrote the Design Sprint). Their site also has great tips and blog posts in case you don't fancy reading the book.
