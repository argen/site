It's no secret that this is the _work from home_ year for most of us. COVID-19 has substantially accelerated the rate in which people working _"9 to 5 office jobs"_ started working from their homes or remote locations without the need of being in the same room with their colleagues.

Having worked remotely for about 7 years, I learnt (sometimes the hard way) many things that helped me collaborate and get things done whilst not being in the same room with others. In this post I want to share some of these with you, hoping it will help you add some tools that you can use during your day to day.

### Own your time

> Make space and design your days for the things that really matter.

Ever got to 5pm on the day and realise you haven't started any of the work you wanted or needed to do? I've been there too.

People often spend time on things that don't matter to them, being drifted away by someone else's priorities or [_Infinity Pools_](https://medium.com/make-time/distractions-are-a-nuisance-but-infinity-pools-are-the-real-problem-e84122d62c0c). Don't be afraid to say no. That doesn't mean you need to become a despicable person. Just make sure to ask what's the purpose of the meeting/call to validate wether you want to commit your time to it or not. If it doesn't need your time, or you have another priority that's a conflict just say you won't attend. You can always review meeting notes or follow up on any actions needed after. If people really need you, they'll insist in you attending.

One technique I really like and learn't from the Make Time book, is "designing my day" with one highlight goal per day. Owning my calendar with appointments with myself to "Focus on XXXX", help me keep track of what I wanted to spend time on during that day. This is also really good as a signal to others that may have access to your calendar that you aren't accepting more meetings for that day or are fully booked. You can always compromise if you want (at the end you are now in control of how you spend your time), but this is a conscious decision. You are not being drift away without your permission.

Don't be just "Busy", use your time with purpose and intention.

A good time to start on this, is before you start a new week. Take a look at your previous week's calendar and identify the things that you could have deleted or removed. Then shift your focus to the upcoming week and start blocking out time or declining invites. Make sure you communicate with colleagues or friends that you need time to focus on other things, so they understand why you aren't joining something they invited you to.

### Async-first

> Use real-time communication sometimes, but favour asynchronous communication most of the time.

What does that mean? The next time you open your calendar app and try to add something or think "we should have a meeting to..." **STOP**. Really think if you need to discuss this in a video call or real-time meeting. Can't this meeting be an email? Or maybe a Slack thread or Direct Message that your colleagues can follow up on their own time. 

Meetings are also expensive for your company. Four people in a meeting for an hour isn't a one hour meeting, it's a four hour meeting. If your average hourly cost of employment is ~£100, then that meeting is £400 investment in only one hour. If you didn't really have a purpose or achieved anything during the meeting it's just waste. That time and money could have been used for something else.

Use chat tools like Slack to your advantage. You should also use Instant Messages and chat more like email rather than a rapid-synchronous 

Meetings should be your last resort, not the first option.

### Explore the great outdoors

### Build (and iterate) a routine

### Get feedback

### More than business

#### Additional resources

Note:


During the retro I remember people mentioning that they were struggling a bit with meeting fatigue and finding time to focus (I am too!). Earlier this year I've read a book that really help me with time management, it's called Make Time https://maketime.blog/articles/ (written by the same guy that wrote the Design Sprint). Their site also has great tips and blog posts in case you don't fancy reading the book.
